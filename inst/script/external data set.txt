The example dta set provided with the workflow includes the following files:
"Treatment1_R1.mzXML"
"Treatment1_R2.mzXML"
"Treatment1_R3.mzXML"
"Mix_R1.mzXML"
"Mix_R2.mzXML"
"Mix_R3.mzXML"

The files are an extract of a bigger data  set used for a non-targeted experiment. Specifically the data are the
results of the analyses of wine samples.
Treatment1 refers to 3 analytical replicates of a red wine, while 'Mix' refers to analytical replicates of a poleed 
sample from all the samples included in the bigger dataset.

The samples were acquired on a Bruker micrOTOFQII in ESI negative mode, using a mass range of 100-1650 Dalton
in MS1 mode.
The generated  .D datafiles  were converted to.mzXML via ProteoWizard MSConvert using the PeackPicking Filter 
and the "Vendor" algorithm.
