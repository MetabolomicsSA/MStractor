## _Introduction_ 

**MStractor** combines the functions for molecular feature extraction present
in XCMS and CAMERA with user friendly dedicated GUIs for LC and MS parameters 
input, graphical QC outputs and descriptive statistics calculation. 

A schematic representation of the workflow is displayed in **Figure 1**, 
reported below. 
The workflow consists of 10 steps with the possibility of running the workflow
using either the most recent xcms functions specific for *XCMSnExp* objects
(**branch a**) or the old set of functions for *xcmsSet* objects 
(**branch b**).
However, the 2 branches perform the same data processing steps and produce
similar outputs. 
The reason of developing 2 parallel frameworks mainly depends on the 
availability of computational power on the user’s end.  Specifically, authors
observed that step **6a** tends to be quite time-consuming in particular when
dealing with complex datasets. Therefore, in case of limited computing 
resources and large datasets, the authors suggest using branch b of the 
workflow.
The 2 frameworks merge at step 8, where the data set is processed 
using CAMERA.
Since the latest release available for CAMERA does not support 
XCMSnEXP objects, the data set object is required to be converted to the 
xcmsSet format prior to this step.

Each step of the framework displayed in Figure 1 involves using 1 or more 
functions. MStractor functions can be classified into 3 different groups:

**1.MStractor specific functions**: developed by the authors to provide 
the user with a friendly and seamless experience. The functions belonging 
to this class mainly involve the use of GUIs allowing parameters input and 
storage to be used later in the workflow. This calss also include functions
to normalise data and calculate basic statistics.

**2.Wrapper functions**: this category includes wrapper functions of xcms and
CAMERA. The function backbone is the xcms (or CAMERA) function and additional
code is used to automate routine operations and produce graphical outputs 
within the selected working directory.


**3.xcms and CAMERA functions**: these functions are basic CAMERA and xcms 
function that are used along the workflow. However, the user is not required
to update the function arguments because all the necessary parameters are 
input in the previous steps of the workflow

## _Data Preparation and File Naming_

Preparing the data and creating the correct working directory and folder 
structure (outside the R environment) is required prior to executing 
the workflow. The raw data files need to be converted to an appropriate
format which can be  easily achieved using various tools freely  available,
such as Proteowizard (ProteWizard, http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/) 
and Massmatrix (MassMatrix, http://www.massmatrix.net/). 
MStractor supported file formats include CDF, mzDATA, mzML and mzXML. 
After conversion, files should be grouped in folders according to their 
class of belonging. Every class-folder needs to be stored within the 
directory ‘MSfiles’. The script will use the ‘MSfiles’ subfolder 
downstream to automatically determine the sample classes required 
for processing. 
If the folder ‘MSfiles’ is not present, the user will encounter errors. 
For each class-folder a minimum of 2 replicates is required.
An example dataset (see Figure2) is provided with the package.

![](./subdirchart.png)

**Figure 2** = 'Project subfolder structure'

File naming is a key aspect for correct visualisation of graphical output.
This becasue a specific function of the workflow assigns different colours 
and symbols to the different sample classes.
In this respect, the filename has to  correspond to the folder name followed 
by an underscore and a number inidicating the biological replicate, 
as displayed in **Figure 2**.

## _Installation _

Download the tar.gz package from
https://github.com/MetabolomicsSA/MStractor/releases
and run the following 
(the setRepositories command
allows downoading the required dependencies from both the 
CRAN and Bioconductor)
Define the tar.gz location.

```{r install_pacakge, eval=FALSE}
setRepositories(ind=1:2)

remotes::install_local("C:/pathtoPackage/MStractor_0.1.0.tar.gz", 
 '               dependencies=NA)

```
```{r load_library, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE}
library(MStractor)

```
## 1. _Acquisition Parameters_

The first step of the workflow consists in running 6 functions that allow
the input of chromatographic, mass spectrometry and peak picking parameters
as well as loading the data and automatically define the visualization 
settings for graphical outputs.

The standard input values provided in each function are based on the settings
of the acquisition instrument used by the authors and, therefore, suitable 
for processing the example data set available within the package. 
These criteria should be changed according to the user’s 
LCMS system configuration, since they can dramatically influence 
the data processing outcome.

### 1.1 _Define Working Directory and Reference Files_

```{r define_project, eval=FALSE}
Project()
#Skip this step if using the dataset provided within the package 
```
use instead:
```{r load_package_dataset, message=FALSE}
path<-system.file("extdata",package = "MStractor")
files <- dir(path, pattern = ".mzXML", full.names = TRUE)

```

The function doesn’t require arguments.
Its execution opens a GUI (Figure 3) allowing the selection of the working 
directory and 2 reference fileschosen from one of the folders within the 
MSfiles directory (e.g.: 2 ‘Mix’ replicates in the example dataset). 
The function also creates a QC folder where graphical outputs to evaluate
the progressing of the workflow are stored .


![](./selectwd.png)

**Figure 3: GUI for project folder selection**

### 1.2 _Input of Chromatographic and Mass Spectrometry Parameters_

ChromParam() allows the user to input the chromatographic parameters 
related to the data set to be processed and that will be stored and used 
in the later stages of the framework. The values to be entered are 
the retention time range of the data set (rt start and rt end), 
the maximum retention time drift observed and the minimum and 
maximum fullwidth at half maximun (FWHM min and max).

MassSpecParam()  is mainly used to input mass spectrometry related parameters. 
The criteria to be entered are the acquisition mode (negative as default); 
the mass range to be considered (mz start and mz end); the number 
of expected charges (default value set at 3); 
the file type (default set to ‘.mzXML’);
the maximum number of chromatographic peaks expected for a single EIC
and the sensitivity.

Both the functions return the input parameteres.

For more details about more details about the parameters consult the xcms
manual:
https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/manuals/xcms/man/xcms.pdf )

```{r eval= TRUE}
ChromParam()

MassSpecParam()
# leave default values if using the package dataset
```

Values are entered using GUIs as displayed in Figure 4.

![](./massspecparam.png)

**Figure 4: example of GUI input parameters**

### 1.3 _Load the Dataset_

```{r eval=FALSE}

LoadData()
#Skip this step if using the dataset provided within the package 

```
The function returns a complete list of the loaded files. It also starts
recording the time necessary for data processing and creates the object 
‘ClassType’ which associates every data file with the class of belonging.


### 1.4 _Define Class Identifiers_

```{r eval=TRUE}

ClassType<-c('Mix','Treatment1')## use only with the provided dataset
DefineClassAttributes(ClassType)
```

The argument of the function is the object ‘ClassType’. The function defines
and returns specific symbols and colours for each sample class, 
which  are then used to produce graphical outputs.

### 1.5 _Define Peak Picking Parameters_

```{r eval=TRUE}
#leave default values if using the package dataset
PeakPickingParam()

```

The function uses GUIs to define xcms peak picking parameters using
the centwave algorithm. These include: minimum and maximum peakwidth,
minimum and maximum m/z error (in ppm), values for the integration
threshold (set at 5000) and signal to noise threshold, the integration
method to be used (1 or 2 as defined by the xcms documentation) and whether
the pick picking should fit the gaussian curve. The default value for 
minimum and maximum m/z error and signal to noise 
(S/N) threshold is ‘none’ and correspond, respectively, to 3.03 and 50 ppm 
and 1000 for S/N value. Detailed information about the mentioned parameters
can be found in the xcms documentation https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/
release/bioc/manuals/xcms/man/xcms.pdf

## 2. _Parameter Evaluation_

This step allows testing the suitability of the input parameters on the 
reference files selected in the first step.

```{r eval=FALSE}
exploreRefs() 

```
Note: In case the package dataset is used, the following needs to be run
```{r eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, results='hide',warning=FALSE}
dir.create("./QC")
SampleGroup<-c("Mix", "Mix")
symbol<-c(1,1)
ClassCol<-c("#FF0000FF", "#FF0000FF")
path<-system.file("extdata",package = "MStractor")
files <- dir(path, pattern = ".mzXML", full.names = TRUE)
test<-files[1:2]
pd <- data.frame(sample_name = sub(basename(test), pattern = filetype,
    replacement ="", fixed = TRUE),sample_group = SampleGroup,
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
ref_data <- readMSData(test, pdata = new("NAnnotatedDataFrame",
    pd), mode = "onDisk")
expRefData(ref_data)
```

First, a GUI allows to define the settings of xcms functions findChromPeaks 
and groupChromPeaks which perform peak picking and grouping of 
molecular features. Secondly, data files are read using 
the xcms function readMSData and, lastly, peak picking and grouping
is carried out. The output of the function is the XCMSnEXP object ‘x_refs’.


```{r eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
refTic(x_refs)
```

The refTic function returns  a  plot of the overlaid TICs for the reference
files

<img src="././Ref_TIC.png" alt="drawing" width="700"/>

**Figure 5: non-aligned overlaid TICs **

```{r eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
get100(x_refs)
```

The get100 function  randomly picks 100 features detected across 
the retention time domain and plots them into a matrix. Using this output,
it is easy to check whether all the features are correctly integrated.

<img src="./EICs_reference_100.png" alt="drawing" width="700"/>

**Figure 6: EICs of 100 features randomly picked across the retention time**

## 3. _Create XCMSnExp Dataset_

An XCMSnEXP dataset containing all the raw files to be processed is 
automatically created based on the folder structure defined while preparing 
the data. 
The function perform the same steps described for exploreRefs(),
with the only difference that the processing is applied to the whole dataset.

```{r eval=FALSE}
peakPickGroup() # don't run if using the example dataset
```

In case the example dataset fullDataSet is used, the following needs to be run

```{r eval=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ClassType<-c('Mix', 'Treatment1')
DefineClassAttributes(ClassType)
path<-system.file("extdata",package = "MStractor")
files <- dir(path, pattern = ".mzXML", full.names = TRUE)
pd <- data.frame(sample_name = sub(basename(files), pattern = filetype,
    replacement = "", fixed = TRUE), sample_group = SampleGroup,
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
raw_data <- readMSData(files =files, pdata = new("NAnnotatedDataFrame",
    pd), mode = "onDisk")
ppgExData(raw_data) 

```

It is important that the input parameters used in this step match the ones 
defined for the reference files. After performing peak picking on each 
datafile,peaks are matched across all samples and grouped using the xcms 
functions 
findChromPeaks and groupChromPeaks. The results are stored in the XCMSnEXP 
object ‘xdata’

## __Workflow Branching__
The workflow forks at step 4, as displayed in **Figure 1**.
From this point on, the user can choose to either proceed with the XCMSnEXP 
object or perform a conversion into a xcmsSet object.
For demonstration purpose, please run each branch separately

This step is dedicated to plot outputs useful for evaluating the data 
processing progress and visualizing macroscopic differences among 
chromatographic profiles. It includes 2 functions for each branch 
of the workflow. 

## _Branch A_

### 4.1 _Print raw EICs and TICs_

```{r eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE}
OverlaidTICs(xdata, 'raw') #raw indicates non-retention time aligned signals
printEICs(xdata, 'raw')

```

For both branches plots of overlaid TIC (**Figure7**) chromatograms and for
individual EICs are stored in the QC directory. 

<img src="./TICs_raw.png" alt="drawing" width="700"/>

**Figure 7**

### 5.1 _Retention time alignment, grouping and peak filling_

Retention time correction parameters are entered via GUI. 
The retention time alignment method currently supported
is ‘loess’ (see xcms manual), while Obiwarp will be implemented
in the future releases. A plot of the retention time deviation 
is also generated and stored in the QC folder.
After correction, features are regrouped and the filling of missing 
signals is performed.

```{r eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE}
RTalign(xdata,'loess')

xdata <- groupChromPeaks(xdata, param = PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = 
        xdata$sample_group, minFraction = 0.3, bw = 20))     

xfilled <- fillChromPeaks(xdata, param =(FillChromPeaksParam(ppm = 50, 
        expandMz = 0.5)))

```

### 6.1 _Print aligned EICs and TICs_

Step 6 replicates the series of functions already described for stage 4, 
with the only difference that retention time aligned TICs and
EICs are generated

```{r eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE}
OverlaidTICs(xdata, 'aligned')        
printEICs(xfilled, 'filled')
#'aligned' and 'filled' indicate retention time aligned signals
```

### 7.1 _Create Summary Datamatrix_

Step 7 is peculiar of **branch a** and collates features information 
generated by the xcms featureDefinition() function with their corresponding
response (either the integrated peak area or maximum intensity). 
The arguments of the function are the filled XCMSnEXP object and the type 
of instrumental response desired (either ‘into’ or ‘maxo’).
After running step seven, the workflow mwrges again and the user has to proceed
with step 8.

```{r eval=TRUE}
CreateDM(xfilled,'maxo')
```

Following this, the xsetConvert function (already described in step 4) reverts
the XCMSnEXP object into the xcmsSet one. This is necessary for the following 
data processing using CAMERA.

```{r eval=TRUE}
xsetConvert(xfilled)
sampnames(xset)<-spn
```


## _Branch B_

First of all, the user needs to revert the object to a xcmsSet it is required to 
execute the following code.

```{r eval=TRUE}
xsetConvert(xdata)
sampnames(xset)<-spn
```

### 4.2 _Print raw EICs and TICs_

```{r eval=FALSE}
getTICs(xcmsSet= xset, pngName= "./QC/TICs_raw.png", rt= "raw")
#raw indicates non-retention time aligned signals
printEICsXset(xset,'raw')

```



### 5.2 _Retention time alignment, grouping and peak filling_

Retention time correction parameters are entered via GUI. 
The retention time alignment method currently supported
is ‘loess’ (see xcms manual), while Obiwarp will be implemented
in the future releases. A plot of the retention time deviation 
is also generated and stored in the QC folder.
After correction, features are regrouped and the filling of missing 
signals is performed.


```{r eval=FALSE}
RTalign_xset(xset,'loess')
xsAlign <- group(xsAlign, method= "nearest", mzVsRTbalance= 10, mzCheck= 
        mzErrAbs,rtCheck= rtDelta, kNN=10)
xsFilled <- fillPeaks(xsAlign, method="chrom", expand.mz=0.5 )s
```

### 6.2 _Print aligned EICs and TICs_

Step 6 replicates the series of functions already described for stage 4, 
with the only difference that retention time aligned TICs and
EICs are generated

```{r eval=FALSE}
getTICs(xcmsSet= xsAlign, pngName= "./QC/TICs_Aligned.png", rt= "corrected")
printEICsXset(xsFilled,'corrected')
# 'corrected' indicates retention time aligned signals
```


## __Workflow Merging__


## 8. _Spectra Reconstruction_

From step 8, the 2 branches merge again into a unique workflow.
Spectra reconstruction is carried out using the function autoCAMERA()that 
includes the 3 CAMERA functions groupFWHM(), findIsotopes() and groupCorr().
A GUI allows the input of the function parameters. Consult CAMERA manual 
for more information:
https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/manuals/CAMERA/man/
CAMERA.pdf.
Using autoCamera, the peak table embedded within the xcmsSet object is 
extracted and features arranged into pseudospectra groups according to 
their retention times. 
Then, based on the maximum expected charge test, isotopic patterns are 
located using the and the features potential belonging to coeluting 
compounds are resolved using a correlation matrix. 

```{r eval=TRUE}
autoCamera(xset)
```

The function generates the PksAn datamatrix, containing the results of
the  spectra reconstruction.

## 9. _Export Matrix_

Step 9 provide a series of 4 functions that generate the final results of 
the workflow.

```{r eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
FilterDM(PksAn, xset)
CollectBP_EICs(BasePks,'filled')##after this step manual curation is necessary 
#the second argument of the funtion is either 'filled' (branch a)
#or "corrected' (branch b)
BasePks_Curated(BasePks)
MedianNormalize(BasePksCur, xset)
```

By using FilterDM() pseudospectra containing less than a fixed 
number of ions (2 by default) are removed from the data matrix.
Then, only the most intense ion for each pseudospectrum is retained 
(base peak response). This function was implemented to obtain a lighter 
data matrix avoiding redundant information and allowing for quick and
efficient downstream data treatment. 

The output is the BasePks object, a matrix summarizing the results of 
data filtering.

CollectBP_EICs() prints the extracted ion chromatograms related to the
base peak matrix in a .png format. The function also returns the time 
required for processing the dataset.
The pngs files are duplicated into 2 directories, named **‘EICs_BasePeaks’**
and **‘EICs_BasePeaks_Curated’**.
The former is used as data back-up, while the latter allows the user
to perform a final curation  on the EICs, by removing those that 
do not containuseful information. 
This represents the only step of the entire workflow where 
a manual input of the user is required.
An example is displayed in **Figure 8**.

<img src="./Curation.png" alt="drawing" width="700"/>


**Figure 8: curation example **

BasePks_Curated() generates an updated data matrix (BasePksCur) with the 
discarded features removed. The final matrix is saved in a 
‘.tsv’ file called ‘Pks,BPs_Curated’ which is saved within the 
working directory.


Lastly, by using MedianNormalize() the curated matrix is normalized 
on the median value. 
This is done to minimize possible minimal run-to-run variation
in the instrument performances. The output is saved in the .tsv file 
‘Normalized Matrix’.

## 10. _Descriptive Statistics_

Additional step of the workflow that allows calculating basic statistics 
(average value, standard deviation and % CV) on the analytical replicates 
of each sample class. The output is stored in separate .tsv file
for each class.

```{r eval=TRUE}
StatsByClass(ClassType, xset)
```

## _Session information_

```{r eval=TRUE}
sessionInfo()
```
